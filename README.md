# Chinese word training app

https://cn-training.netlify.com

This is a WIP of a simple flashcard app for the chinese words in the "Practical Audio-visual Chinese" books.

I made this app as a way to help classmates and myself in the training of the words in each of the lessons in the books.

The icons were generated using https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/

https://github.com/tomcumming/tocfl-word-list/ was used to generate the TOCFL words
